## Dependencies

- This is compiled using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), in order to create a single static HTML file that contains all slides from webflow without requiring us to use some sort of iframe option. To install that, follow the directions found on its website. 
- The original generated design is from [Webflow](https://webflow.com/).
## Directory Structure

To get an in-depth look at the directory structure of a general [jekyll site go here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).

root directory

* README.md 
	- You are here.
* index.html
	- compiled index for the feature. This is what people look at. 
* buildindex.sh
	- calling this function in the root directory copies the contents of the `build/_site/` folder into the root folder. 
* build/
	- directory that contains the working jekyll directories. See below
* css/, fonts/, images/, js/, and assets/ are all directories that are copied over from the `build/_site/` folder. They contain what they say they do, and are referenced within the `index.html` or the stylesheets, etc. More info on their contents below. 


build/ directory
1.	root 
	* index.html 
		- Contains the _include/ html files that are merged in, with the variables on each entry that will be used within that _include file. Will be merged into _layouts/default.html	
	* _config.yml
		- Contains meta data for jekyll. Read more detailed info [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).
2.	_layout/
	* The _layouts/ folder is the Jekyll folder that contains layouts for any type of page within a jekyll site. 
	* default.html		
		- All CSS and JS should be linked here. **Any library you want to link should be added or removed from here.**
		- Jekyll merges in the markup from the index.html file here. 
3.	_site/
	* This is the folder that is generated by Jekyll and holds the merged static webpages. You do not need to add or subtract anything from it, as it should automatically update. It will be copied to the root directory when the buildindex.sh script is run. 
4. _includes/ 
	* All html files taken from assets/ and edited down to be injected into index.html. They have had the metadata and js removed, leaving only the contents of the `div class="div-container">` with an added id that corresponds to the name of the particular slide. 
5. js/
	* script.js
		- script that has any of our added custon js.
	* actions.js
		- This is the json (stored as a js variable because I'm lazy) that tells you what each subslide within each slide does. The script.js file iterates through each slide's list of actions (adding or removing animation/transition classes to specific DOM elements) when that slide and subslide is called. 
	* lib/ 
		- various scripts and libraries you may need. 
6. css/	
	* All of the default styles recieved from webflow.
	* addionalStyles.css
		- custom css that I've added.
7. _assets/
	* The original files recieved from webflow's export that we have moved into includes/, css/, js/, images/, and fonts/.
8. _legacy
	* Old stuff

## Installation and Development

### Running Jekyll (for development and making changes)
- Build the Jekyll _site/ folder by running `jekyll build` in your build/ directory. I recommend running `jekyll build --watch`, which automatically rebuilds your _site folder whenever you change something in the repository. More on this on jekyll's website. 
- Run the jekyll server by running `jekyll serve`. You can now see your page at `http://localhost:4000/`
- To view the original functioning design, go to `http://localhost:4000/assets/`. This is useful for seeing and understanding how the design is meant to look. 
- **NOTE: You must run the jekyll commands from the `build/` directory, not the root directory. 

### Committing changes to the root directory
- When you're at a point that you want to push to github/staging/production, before you run your git commands, you must run the `buildindex.sh` command from the root directory. 

`$ bash buildindex.sh`

Then you can add, commit, and push changes to the remote repo. 

That is all....have a nice day.
